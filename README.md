# Data Set
hmeq.csv data set link from kaggle

# How to Run the Code:

- Run the code cell by cell as you move along through the notebook.
- The hmeq.csv data set is required for this notebook
- This code requires you to use pip install to download the imbalance-learn module. This is built into the notebook.
- Note that the SVM classifier can potentially take a few minutes
